# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Static HTML Structure**: Uses a traditional HTML5 document structure with basic semantic elements
- **Minimal Content**: Currently contains only a heading (`<h1>`) and paragraph (`<p>`) for demonstration purposes
- **Inline JavaScript**: Includes embedded tracking/analytics code directly in the HTML head section

## Design Patterns
- **Single Page Application**: Currently operates as a simple static webpage
- **Direct Script Embedding**: Analytics code is embedded directly rather than loaded from external files
- **Basic HTML5 Structure**: Follows standard HTML5 document structure with proper DOCTYPE declaration

## Technical Decisions
- **No Framework**: Uses vanilla HTML without any frontend frameworks or libraries
- **Inline Scripting**: Analytics tracking is implemented through inline JavaScript variables
- **Minimal Styling**: No CSS styling has been implemented yet

# External Dependencies

## Analytics/Tracking
- **Tracking Script**: Contains embedded JavaScript variables (NS_CSM_*) that appear to be related to analytics or content management tracking
- **Tracking Parameters**: Includes specific tracking IDs and configuration values for external monitoring services

## Potential Future Dependencies
- **CSS Framework**: No styling framework is currently implemented
- **JavaScript Libraries**: No external JavaScript libraries are currently included
- **Web Fonts**: No external font dependencies are present
